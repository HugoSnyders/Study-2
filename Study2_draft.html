      <h2>Welcome! Please read the following consent form carefully.</h2>
      <p>
        In this scientific study we are interested in how people process and
        evaluate new information. We will begin by asking you to what extent you
        agree with statements concerning 5 different topics.
        After that, you will be asked to indicate whether you think various news
        headlines are true or false. Finally, we will ask you about your political preferences,
        and debrief you on the experiment. In total, this task will take approximately
        15 minutes to complete. In return for your participation, you will
        receive a financial compensation of $2.75 (following the policy on
        participant payment by Prolific).
      </p>
      <p>
        This study is conducted by researchers at the Behavioral Science
        Institute (BSI) at Radboud University (Nijmegen, The Netherlands). The
        study has been reviewed independently by the Ethics Committee Social
        Sciences (ECSS) of the Radboud University and there is no formal
        objection to this study. Your participation in this study is entirely
        voluntary. If you decide not to participate, there will be no
        consequences. If, during the course of the research, you wish to
        withdraw your consent and terminate your participation, you have every
        right to do so at all times. Again, there will be no adverse
        consequences for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following section, you will read how we handle your data and
        ensure your privacy. If you agree, you can provide consent and proceed
        to the study.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        For the current research it is necessary to collect, use, and store some
        personal data concerning your demographics to answer our scientific
        research question. This demographic data includes the following, and is
        provided to us by Prolific:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Sex</li>
        <li>First language</li>
        <li>Current country of residence</li>
        <li>Nationality</li>
        <li>Country of birth</li>
        <li>Student status</li>
        <li>Employment status</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For this experiment, it is also necessary to collect specific personal
        data, namely your political preferences. We will collect this data by
        asking you to what extent you affiliate with either the Democratic or
        Republican party.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, in order to be able to pay you, it is necessary to collect your
        ProlificID.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the consent form, you are asked to give explicit permission for the
        collection, use, and storage of the above-mentioned (specific) personal
        data. Without this permission, you cannot participate in the study.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information you provide for the current research purposes is treated
        with the utmost care and is accessible to authorized staff only. Your
        anonymized research data will be stored for at least 10 years after the
        research has been completed.
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing research data</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the importance of control, reuse and/or replication of research
        results, research data (including any anonymous personal data) are
        increasingly shared with or made available to other researchers. Your
        data will be anonymized prior to this form of sharing. This means that
        you can no longer be identified on the basis of these data. If you do
        not want your anonymized data to be shared, you can request to have your
        data deleted up to a maximum of 1 month after completion of the
        research.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some persons and organizations must have access to your personal and
        research data. This is necessary to test whether the research has been
        carried out properly and reliably. These persons and supervisory
        authorities inspecting your data for verification include: authorized
        persons within the Behavioral Science Institute or Radboud University
        (for example a dean, director or data officer) and (inter) national
        supervisory authorities (for example the Dutch Data Protection Authority
        and the Netherlands Board on Research Integrity). They are held to
        inspecting your data on a strictly confidential basis. You will be asked
        to grant permission for this access. Without this permission, you cannot
        participate in the study.
      </p>
      <h2>Additional information</h2>
      <p>
        Radboud University is responsible for compliance with the General Data
        Protection Regulation (GDPR) when processing your personal data. The
        researcher ensures that your privacy and the conditions attached to it
        are safeguarded and he/she adheres to the Dutch code of conduct for
        scientific integrity and university policy regarding the storage and
        management of personal and research data when conducting this research.
        You have the right to withdraw your consent for the processing of your
        personal data at any time. Your personal data will then be deleted. You
        can find the Radboud University Privacy Statement at:

      <p>
        Thank you for participating in this study. The aim of this study is to
        better understand how people's prior beliefs (and the certainty with
        which they hold those beliefs) influence their likelihood of believing
        in headlines that either contradict or conform to those prior beliefs,
        and the extent to which they deliberate when assessing those headlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        NOTE: <br />
        As part of this experiment you will have seen several headlines that
        were not factual (these headlines were created with generative AI and
        were not based on any factual evidence). Below we will list which groups
        of headlines are fake (printed in <b>bold</b>), and we will also give an
        explanation of why the best available evidence contradicts the content
        of those headlines:

      </p>
      <p>
        Explanation: the current scientific consensus is that there is clear
        evidence that the earth's climate is warming, and that this is due to
        human activity. A recent study showed that this consensus in the
        peer-reviewed scientific literature is greater than 99% (<a target='_blank'

      </p>
      <p>
        Explanation: COVID-19 vaccinations are safe and effective. The safety of
        COVID-19 vaccines has been rigorously tested, monitored, and evaluated
        since their emergency use authorization. COVID-19 vaccination continues
        to be the best way to protect against serious illness, and the benefits
        of vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks associated with
        rare side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more information about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19
        vaccination, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention provides a
        helpful overview here:

        <b>Headlines that suggest GMO foods are unsafe for human consumption</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Explanation: research and studies conducted over the years have shown
        that, based on the GMO foods that are currently available on the market,
        there is no evidence that GMO foods are less safe to eat than non-GMO
        foods. For a detailed overview of what GMO foods are how they are
        regulated, see the following page by the World Health Organization:
        <a target='_blank'

          to human health</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Explanation: the current scientific consensus regarding 5G is that no
        credible evidence has been found that causally links it to any adverse
        health outcomes. Provided that overall exposure remains below
        international exposure guidelines set by the International Commission on
        Non-Iodizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), there is no reason to
        anticipate any negative outcomes for public health.
      </p>
      <p>
        The World Health Organization provides more information about 5G
        specifically here:

          >Headlines that suggest widespread voter fraud took place during the
          2020 US presidential election</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Explanation: there is no credible evidence that widespread voter fraud
        took place during the 2020 election. Although there may have been a
        small number of cases (the Heritage foundation, a conservative think
        tank, reported 1,500 proven instances across the US - see here:
        <a target='_blank'href="https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/#choose-a-state"
          >https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/#choose-a-state</a
        >
        ), this is unlikely to make a difference for an election in which almost
        155 million votes were cast (<a target='_blank'
          href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/2020-presidential-election-voting-report.html"
          >https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/2020-presidential-election-voting-report.html</a

        check of potential cases of voter fraud in six battleground states
        (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and
        found fewer than 475 instances of voter fraud (<a target='_blank'

        Moreover, a guide to statistical claims published in the Proceedings of

        The courts have also dismissed more the 50 lawsuits of alleged voter
        fraud:
